# EmailOctopus

An API client for the [EmailOctopus][] email marketing service, allowing
you to create/view/update/destroy campaigns, lists, and contacts.

For more information on how to set up your account, read the [API docs][].

**NOTE:** This project is alpha software, tests are still being written
but most of the logic is there.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "email_octopus", git: "https://github.com/gokaykucuk/email_octopus", branch: :master
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install email_octopus

## Usage

First, configure the `EmailOctopus` library so it can be used with your
account. After obtaining your API key, add the following before your
application is initialized. For Rails apps, this might be
**config/initializers/email_octopus.rb**

```ruby
EmailOctopus.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'your-email-octopus-api-key'
end
```

You can now perform CRUD actions on the various resources that the API
provides.

Below is a short summary of what you can do with the library. For more
information, read the [RDoc][] documentation.

### Creating a new list

```ruby
list = EmailOctopus::List.create name: 'Newsletter'
```

### Adding a contact to that list

```ruby
list = EmailOctopus::List.find 'previous-list-id'
contact = EmailOctopus::Contact.create(
  first_name: 'Lester',
  last_name: 'Tester',
  email_address: 'lester.tester@example.com',
  subscribed: true,
  list_id: list.id
)
```

### Creating a new campaign for that list

```ruby
list = EmailOctopus::List.find 'previous-list-id'
campaign = EmailOctopus::Campaign.new(
  list_id: list.id,
  name: 'hello world',
  content: 'test'
)
```

### Removing a user from the contact list

```ruby
contact = EmailOctopus::Contact.find 'previous-contact-id'
contact.destroy
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
